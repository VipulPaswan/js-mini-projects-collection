# Day 21 – Stack Visualizer (Mini Project)

This folder contains an interactive **Stack Visualizer** built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript as part of my #100DaysLogicChallenge.  
This project visually demonstrates how stack operations work internally and provides real-time interaction for push, pop, and peek operations.

---

## 🚀 Project Features

### ✔ Push Operation
- Adds a new element to the stack  
- Auto-generates a label if input is empty  
- Prevents overflow (max 10 items)  
- Updates UI immediately  

### ✔ Pop Operation
- Removes the top-most element  
- Shows an “Underflow” error if stack is empty  
- UI updates in real time  

### ✔ Peek Operation
- Shows the top element  
- Highlights the top visual block  
- Displays status message  

### ✔ Live Stack Visualization
- Each stack element appears as a colored block  
- Top element is highlighted during peek  
- Shows empty state message when stack has no items

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Stack operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty)  
- Class-based JavaScript  
- DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates  
- Using Tailwind CSS for clean design  
- Handling overflow & underflow states  
- Animating and updating the stack visually  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **HTML** – Page structure  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling & UI  
- **JavaScript (ES6 Classes)** – Stack logic  
- **DOM APIs** – Real-time visualization

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project
Visualizing data structures makes them easier to understand.  
This Stack Visualizer helped reinforce:
- How stack memory works  
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle  
- Error handling (underflow & limits)  
- Concept → Implementation → Visualization

## 🔗 DSA Journey Connection
- Day 09 → Stack (Core Concepts)  
- Day 11 → Queue  
- Day 13 → Deque  
- Day 16 → Heap  
- Day 18 → Priority Queue  
- **Day 21 → Stack Visualizer (Project)**  

Every day is building logical thinking through visualization + implementation.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Adding animations  
- Adding reverse-stack visualization  
- Adding dark mode  

Staying consistent with my 100-day journey toward stronger DSA + logic fundamentals.
